A nice home webpage with the latest image from
`<http://visibleearth.nasa.gov>`__.

Provides some scripts that download the image and a few
information from the VisibleEarth rss feed.
A script can be run at login and every few hours to check
we have the latest image downloaded.

Xml and curl libraries necessary.
GD library necessary for putting image in landscape
(this can be removed).
