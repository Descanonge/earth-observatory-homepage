A nice home webpage with the latest image from
`<http://visibleearth.nasa.gov>`__.

Provides some scripts that download the image and a few
information from the VisibleEarth rss feed.
A script can be run at login and every few hours to check
we have the latest image downloaded.

Curl libraries necessary, and `SimpleDOM <https://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.io/>`__.
GD library necessary for putting image in landscape
(this can be removed).

You can clone this in any webroot subfolder and move index.html and style.css up a directory.
